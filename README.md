Chinese calendar is a lunisolar calendar based on the motions of the sun and the moon as observed on the earth. While each month is determined by the moon and thus is lunar, the solar terms, or jieqi, are determined by the positions of the sun. That's why the date of the first day of a lunar month varies but the date of a solar term stays relatively fixed. Since the period of revolution for the moon around the earth and that of the earth around the sun are not exact multiples, it is necessary to add a leap month once in a while and the rules for adding a leap month is simple in principle but obscure to one without the required astronomical knowledge and difficult to compute and apply. The result is that few people know how to compute the Chinese calendar and the printed calendars are almost the sole source for most people to know the time of traditional Chinese holidays such as the Spring Festival or the Mid-Autumn Festival.

中国农历是一种以月亮和太阳运动为基础的历法，又称阴阳历。每个月由月亮的运动来确定，是为阴历，所以每月初一的公历日期不定。而节气则是由太阳的位置确定，系阳历，是故节气的公历日期基本固定。由于地球绕太阳公转的周期不可被月亮绕地球公转的周期整除，农历一段时间后就要加入闰月。虽说增加闰月的规则并不难描述，但若没有必须的天文知识则不易懂，且计算复杂不易应用。结果就是只有极少数人知道如何计算农历，印刷的日历成了大多数人知道如春节或中秋节等农历节日的公历日期的唯一来源。
